# Zomato Data Analysis
Project Overview
The Zomato Data Analysis project focuses on extracting meaningful insights from a dataset containing information about restaurants listed on Zomato. The goal of this analysis is to explore various trends in customer behavior, restaurant types, ratings, and votes to better understand the restaurant landscape. Through this analysis, we uncover key factors influencing restaurant success and customer preferences, and we also visualize the results using graphs and heatmaps.

Key Features:
Cleaning and preprocessing Zomato's restaurant data.
Analyzing restaurant types, online orders, ratings, votes, and approximate costs.
Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends in the dataset using various plots.
Identifying key restaurants with the highest customer engagement (measured by votes).
Heatmap analysis to show the relationship between restaurant types and online ordering.
